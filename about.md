Hi, I'm Kim. I am a Site Reliability Engineer at [Fairwinds Ops](https://www.fairwinds.com/). Prior to Fairwinds, I was an Instructor, Developer, and Curriculum Designer for the Web Development Program at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado. I _love_ working at the intersection of tech and adult education. 

In my spare time, I am a CrossFit athlete and the Head of Education and Content for [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/), a 2-day conference for developers, designers, strategists and tech leaders.
