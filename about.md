I am a Site Reliability Engineer at [ReactiveOps](https://www.reactiveops.com/). Prior to RO, I was an Instructor, Curriculum Designer and Instrctional Coach for the Web Development Immersive Program at Galvanize, a codeschool in Denver, Colorado. 

In my spare time, I am active in the Colorado Chapter of Leadership for Educational Equity, and I am the co-founder of [diversity](https://hirediversity.us), a company that is finding ways to connect diverse talent to tech companies.
