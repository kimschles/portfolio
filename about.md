Hi, I'm Kim. I am a Site Reliability Engineer at [ReactiveOps](https://www.reactiveops.com/). Prior to RO, I was an Instructor, Developer, and Curriculum Designer for the Web Development Program at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado. I _love_ working at the intersection of tech and adult education. 

In my spare time, I am active in the Colorado Chapter of Leadership for Educational Equity, and I am the co-founder of [diversity](https://hirediversity.us), a company that is striving to make the tech industry more equitable.
