summary:    Demystifying PATH, the Filesystem Hierarchy and PS1

This is a companion blog post for a presentation I gave at the February 2020 DenverScript Meetup.

You can find the video recording and slide deck on my [talks](/talks) page. 

## The Path Variable 
* `PATH` is an enviornment variable.
* The variable is a colon-delimited string. The directory before each colon contains exectable code and is invoked through a command, like `pwd`.
* To see the value, run `echo $PATH` from your command line 
* Here's an example path: 
    
    `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
    
* In the example, these are the directories in the path: 
    * `/usr/local/sbin`
    * `/usr/local/bin`
    * `/usr/sbin`
    * `/usr/bin`
    * `/sbin`
    * `/bin`

* When you type a text command and hit `RETURN` your computer looks in all the directories listed in the path, and if it finds code for the command, it will execute the program.
* Most of the built-in system commands are written in the C programming langauge.
* For MacOS and Linux, to change your path, find and edit it in your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

## The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
* The root directory contains folders and files under the forward-slash, `/`.
* The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard defines the organization of the root directory. 
* Most Unix-like operating systems (UNIX, Linux, MacOS, etc.) organize their root directories according to the FHS. 

A few directories in the root directory:
* `/bin`: stands for binary, and contains common commands used by system adminstrators and users 
* `/sbin`: stands for system binaries, andontains root-only commands and commands that pair well with commands in `/bin`
* `/usr`: has some read-only data, and lots of common commands in `/usr/bin`

## The PS1 Variable
* `PS1` is an enviornment variable that creates the default command prompt you see at the beginning of your command line.
* To see the value, run `echo $PS1`.
* Here's an example PS1: 

    `\u@\h:\w\$`

* In the example, the username (`\u`), hostname (`\h`) and working directory (`\w`) come before the dollar sign, and are separated by `@` and `:`.
* On my computer, this PS1 shows up as `kschlesinger@kims-macbook-air:~$` 
* To add colors to your PS1, open your `bash_profile`, `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` and add [ANSI color escape sequences](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4842424/list-of-ansi-color-escape-sequences) before each section of your PS1. Add an emoji if you'd like. Here's an example: 

    `export PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\]\$ 🌵 "` 

* On my computer, this PS1 shows up as `kschlesinger@kims-macbook-air:~$ 🌵 ` with the username in teal, the hostname in green and the working directory in yellow.
