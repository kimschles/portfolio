## The Path Variable 
* `PATH` is an enviornment variable.
* The variable is colon delimted string. The directory before each colon contains exectable code. 
* To see the value, run `echo $PATH` from your command line 
* Here's an example path: 
    
    `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
    
* In the example, these are the directories in the path: 
    * `/usr/local/sbin`
    * `/usr/local/bin`
    * `/usr/sbin`
    * `/usr/bin`
    * `/sbin`
    * `/bin`

* When you type a text command and hit `RETURN` your computer looks in all the directories listed in the path, and if it finds code for the command, it will execute the program.
* Most of the built-in system commands are written in the C programming langauge.
* For MacOS and Linux, to change your path, find and edit it in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
